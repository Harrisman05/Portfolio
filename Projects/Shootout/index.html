          Using Pyinstaller to bundle the animation file into an executable

        <p>
          Pyinstaller is used to bundle a Python application and all of it's
          dependencies into a single package.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>--onefile flag:</span> Ensures that the program is compiled
            into one file
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>--w flag:</span> ensures any python printed to console is not
            visible when executes the file
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>--i flag:</span> Makes the icon of the execution file a
            specfic image
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Running the executable file from File Explorer</h3>
        <img src="compiled_file_and_game.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Once Pyinstaller compiles the game into an executable, a build and
          dist folder is created.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user can run the game without Python being installed on their
          operating system
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>animation:</span> When double-clicked, this file will load up
            the game, as displayed in the image above
          </li>
          <li>
            The animation file must be in the same directory as all the
            dependancies, otherwise it will not be able to load in the assets
          </li>

        <p>
          NSIS can be used to to compress a zip file of the the whole project
          folder into a single application.
        </p>
        <p>
          This single application can then be either directly downloaded or sent
          to users to install on their operating system and play the game.
